== Scope

An OGC name must be provided for each normative element within an OGC specification, as described in the OGC Specification Model â€“ Modular Specifications (OGC 08-131r3). These include requirement, requirements-module, requirements-class, conformance-test, conformance-module, conformance-class, and the specification as a whole.

Note that a specification as a whole is the structure composed of constituent requirements- and conformance-classes. This is distinguished from a specification document or standard, which is identified by an OGC name from the 'doc' branch.
